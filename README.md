# C-and-Linux-Code
I created a set of C files that can be run on the linux operating system to perform various tasks. countnames.c is able to count the number of names in a file and returns the names and the frequency of each name. countnames_parallel.c is able to count the number of names in multiple files and returns the names and the frequency of each name. coutnames_parallel_updated.c is able to perform the same functions as countnames_parallel.c but is able to perform it using pipes. countnames_threaded.c is able to perform the same functionality as countnames_parallel but uses threads insteads and two or more file need to be scanned. mem_tracer.c prints out all the array and linked list objects along with the memory usage statements to an output file. proc_manager.c is able to take in multiple linux commands through stdin and output the results of all those commands in an output file. proc_manager_updated.c is an updated version of proc_manager.c which is able to output results into the .out file and errors into the .err file.

Collaborated with one other person on the files
